A desktop calculator.
Implemented in such a way that it can handle whole mathematical operations.
There is an output of the history of operations and a window for error messages.
All buttons can be activated using the buttons from the keyboard. On some buttons
that are not so obvious, there are hints with which buttons they can be activated.
